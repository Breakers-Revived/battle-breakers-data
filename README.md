## What is this repository?

This is a supporting repository for [Breakers Revived](https://github.com/dippyshere/battle-breakers-private-server). It contains data from the Battle Breakers client, which is required by the server emulator for it to function properly. This repository does *not* contain any game assets like textures, sounds, or models; only the metadata of files that the server uses and references when performing operations.

To use the server emulator, check out the [Breakers Revived repository](https://github.com/dippyshere/battle-breakers-private-server) and follow the instructions there.

## What version is this based on?

The majority of files in this repository are from the final version of Battle Breakers (1.88.244 CL r17036752), released in 2021; however for backwards compatibility with older clients, some files are from 1.0-1.86.
